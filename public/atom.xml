    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Our goal for this project is to design a color picker that helps everyone (even your grandma) pick &#8220;better&#8221; color combinations. In other words, is color picking limited to those with taste or is there some underlying relationship we can utilize? Can we write an algorithm that selects great color combinations for us?</p>

<p>Below is an experiment I call <em>The Colors of Dribbble</em>. It picks a random color and then displays the palettes of the most popular shots from <a href="http://dribbble.com/">Dribbble</a> that contain that color. The refresh button on the right is the base color. Sorry, no Internet Explorer.</p>

<script src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.0.0/jquery.min.js"></script>


<script src="../javascripts/colors.js"></script>


<p><link href="http://nathanspeller.com/stylesheets/colors.css" media="screen, projection" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"></p>

<div class="color-wheel">
  <div id="circle"></div>
  <div id="circle-border"></div>
  <div id="spokes"></div>
</div>




<div class="color-blocks">
  <div class="block-house"></div>
</div>


<p>Below the color wheel are palettes of the top eight colors from each shot. If you hover over the bottom palettes it will hide all other palettes from the color wheel. On the surface it&#8217;s a fun tool to play with. For example, look for the color rules below when hovering.</p>

<p><img src="http://nathanspeller.com/images/color-rules.png" alt="color rules" /></p>

<h3>A Color Formula</h3>

<p>If you&#8217;ve ever dabbled in color theory you&#8217;ll know there are a ton of rules for picking color combos. You can spend days reading about various color systems, HSV, RGB, CMYK, CIELAB, additive/subtractive color mixing, etc. The rule-based nature of this information makes a &#8220;color-combo formula&#8221; seem plausible.</p>

<p>Additionally, there won&#8217;t be any new colors years from now. The color spectrum of the future will be exactly the same as it is today. It&#8217;s neat to think we already have access to the color palettes of the year 3000. Because of this, it seems we have everything we need to write an end-all-be-all algorithm for picking good-looking color palettes.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, it&#8217;s not that simple.</p>

<h3>Culture, Context, and Time</h3>

<p>There is a lot more involved in picking color combinations than the rules and guidelines you&#8217;ll find in basic color theory. Other things that matter include:</p>

<ul>
<li> Time - what looked good in the seventies may look terrible now</li>
<li> Medium - the colors of a movie poster would make a poor street sign</li>
<li> Popularity - skeuomorphism may be beautiful until everyone does it</li>
<li> Existing Landscape - a competitor&#8217;s colors are off-limits</li>
</ul>


<p>…suddenly color picking starts to look a lot like predicting stocks.</p>

<p>Ultimately, there is no such thing as a good color combination in a vacuum. What is considered good-looking requires information about society, and about existing color combinations in the space or industry. We need to know what colors are fashionable, trendy, or overused in the world. We need <em>a lot</em> of information.</p>

<p>What does this mean for our color picking algorithm? Do we just give up? How could we possibly collect and incorporate all of this information into a color picker?</p>

<h3>Big Data</h3>

<p>Believe it or not, this information is already available to us. Sites like Dribbble, Forrst, or Behance have created dense communities of designers with taste, sharing their work. At the time of this post there have been 108,854,356,487 pixels &#8220;dribbbled&#8221; on Dribbble. Not until now could you so quickly aggregate a &#8220;snapshot&#8221; of great design today. A place that collects samples of the best work from (only) those with taste.</p>

<p>From this we can measure what is up-and-coming, popular, or on it&#8217;s way out in the world of design.  We can use the innate understanding from these designers to make color picking easier for everyone else. In the not-too-distant future, we may even be able to measure (and generate?) good taste.</p>

<p>We&#8217;ll be releasing a more full-featured color picker soon where you can breakdown colors by medium, see the original artwork, etc.</p>

    <link href="http://nathanspeller.com/inbound-marketing-for-startups/"/>
    <updated>2013-02-18T18:25:00-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://nathanspeller.com/inbound-marketing-for-startups</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>Nate, the product is built. It&#8217;s mobile, it&#8217;s real-time, and it scales to millions of users. I&#8217;ve spent two years building it and it&#8217;s my friggin&#8217; masterpiece. Now how the hell do we market this? Just make a blog and tweet about it yeah?</p></blockquote>

<p>It&#8217;s 2013 and the most prevalent marketing strategy for first-time founders goes like this:</p>

<ol>
<li>Launch the product</li>
<li>Create a blog and write a post or two (before giving up)</li>
<li>Start sharing sorta-related-to-my-industry links on Twitter</li>
<li>Wonder where all the customers are hiding</li>
</ol>


<h3>The Problem is Information Overload</h3>

<p>If you google &#8220;marketing for startups&#8221; you&#8217;ll find over 63M results. There&#8217;s Facebook, Twitter, Google+, StumbleUpon, LinkedIn, PR guides, SEO, keyword analysis, lead generation, newsletters, adwords, landing page optimization, guest posts, online forums&#8230; the list goes on.</p>

<p>Founders have no idea where to start. Trying to implement all of these marketing strategies will get you nowhere. This is like teaching yourself to code by copy-pasting snippets from the internet: you might get lucky, but you won&#8217;t learn much.</p>

<p>Lets look at it from a different angle.</p>

<h3>Getting Noticed</h3>

<p>Imagine I placed you in a crowd of thousands of people and asked you to get my attention. You&#8217;d probably wave and shout in my direction. Fine.</p>

<p>Now what if I told you every person in this crowd was trying to get my attention. What would you do then? Everyone would be waving and shouting and you&#8217;d have to resort to some ridiculous stunt to get noticed. Streaking perhaps. Eventually others would copy you and you&#8217;d have to come up with something more creative.</p>

<p>Now imagine the goal wasn&#8217;t just to get my attention, but to keep my attention over an extended period of time. (Pretty difficult when you&#8217;re surrounded by thousands of naked screaming people). At this point, we can rest assured that every stunt will be copied and rendered useless. Earning this long-term attention is the challenge of marketing.</p>

<p>Suddenly the common marketing strategy looks ridiculous. You&#8217;ve got a spammy blog, and a bunch of social networking accounts because <em>that&#8217;s what every other business does</em>. How can you earn the attention and respect of your customers when your strategy is based on just fitting in?</p>

<h3>Marketing Purpose</h3>

<p>It&#8217;s common to think your primary marketing goal is to make sales. It&#8217;s not. If that were your only goal then choosing a marketing channel isn&#8217;t any easier. Every strategy may be profitable for someone, but not necessarily for you.</p>

<p>Instead, your marketing purpose is to <em>provide unique and valuable content to your customer</em>. To be an expert at solving their biggest problems because you want them to succeed. In return, you will earn their attention, their trust, and ultimately their money.</p>

<p>Ask yourself these questions:</p>

<ul>
<li> If our job were to simply help our customers solve their biggest problems in any way possible, would our product change?</li>
<li> How much useful material do we have to share? A book&#8217;s worth? A course&#8217;s worth? A years’ worth?</li>
<li> Are our topics <em>truly unique</em> or are we just regurgitating common ideas?</li>
<li> Do we need to wait for our launch to start marketing? (No)</li>
<li> Finally, what channels are best for helping our customers?</li>
</ul>


<p>The last question is where most startups begin: picking the tools before they really understand the task. Instead, become a champion of your customers&#8217; problems. Be their sidekick and let their pain guide your actions. Only then can you truly engage your audience and learn what resonates with them. You can start making sense of these <a href="http://www.seomoz.org/blog/the-noob-guide-to-online-marketing-with-giant-infographic-11928">marketing checklists</a>, and potential <a href="http://tractionbook.com/">traction</a> verticals. Your marketing strategy will have a purpose that will guide all the decisions you make.</p>

    <link href="http://nathanspeller.com/distraction-creep/"/>
    <updated>2013-02-04T12:15:00-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://nathanspeller.com/distraction-creep</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The last time I was bored was over a decade ago.</p>

<p>In middle school there would be days where I was in pain because I had nothing to do. Play a game? No one to play with. Go outside? Too cold. A restless hunger would build inside me. Slouched on the couch like a zombie, I&#8217;d wait and pray for a distraction.</p>

<p>My wish came true a few months later in the form of a Sony Vaio desktop computer, fully-equipped with purple trim, 56k modem, and the revolutionary Pentium II processor. It was our family&#8217;s first computer and it was glorious. Send an <em>electronic mail</em> to my friends? Done. Only forty minutes to download a song? Amazing. Google…anything?! I felt like a god.</p>

<p>Yet sometime between then and college, that excitement turned to habit. Without thinking, I started consuming for the sake of consumption, constantly checking my news feed or RSS reader. Refresh, refresh, refresh.</p>

<p>I would decline college events with &#8220;sorry, gotta prepare for this exam,&#8221; only to procrastinate with silly YouTube videos. Adventures were reduced to Foursquare check-ins, jokes were evaluated based on their tweet-worthiness, and personal photos were filtered by how I wanted to be perceived online. My life was quickly being consumed by internet distractions.</p>

<p>So I quit.</p>

<p>I shut down my Facebook, abandoned Twitter and checked out of Foursquare. I got rid of my RSS feeds and limited email to once a day. I blocked YouTube, TechCrunch, HN and Reddit and got rid of every distracting app on my iPhone. And while I waited for the withdrawal symptoms to hit me, something surprising happened: they never came.</p>

<p>Instead, a clear sense of possibility came over me. Without all the little distractions my mind finally felt uncluttered. Small gaps in the day became opportunities to start new side projects, meet up with friends, or even to simply rest. It was like waking up on a Saturday morning as a kid, knowing that the whole day was mine.</p>

<p>Today I&#8217;ve added a few things back. I subscribe to the HN100 and couple other feeds, and I&#8217;ve removed my site-blocker now that the habits have disappeared. I now fill the gaps with activities like writing or learning music. Overall, it&#8217;s been a tremendously gratifying behavioral change.</p>

<h3>The Bigger Picture</h3>


<p>Life is about the decisions we make. Yet every time you reach for your phone or news feed, you are avoiding a decision. It may be small, but they quickly add up, and pretty soon you&#8217;re postponing goals and opportunities. Side-projects go unfinished. Exercise and health gets put off. New Years resolutions are forgotten. Every goal requires a ton of mental energy, but filling your mind with imgurs and instagrams only makes it that much harder.</p>

<p>And this is not just my problem. No other time period has experienced such an overload of information, and anyone can get buried in the noise.</p>

<p>From airports to restaurants, conferences to weddings, I see it everywhere. With smart phones in hand, people are adding filters to photos, scanning countless tweets, and anxiously waiting for enough &#8216;likes&#8217; to validate their digital identities. New services appear everyday, fending for your attention, claiming to be the next big thing. Yet the end result is just another consumer-facing digital filler. Millions of people mindlessly swiping, pinching, and flicking through life&#8217;s distractions.</p>

<p>Refresh. Refresh. Refresh.</p>

    <link href="http://nathanspeller.com/paths-to-success/"/>
    <updated>2013-01-19T15:50:00-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://nathanspeller.com/paths-to-success</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Step 1. Steal Underpants <br>
Step 2. ????? <br>
Step 3. PROFIT</p>

<p>Know this meme? It&#8217;s from a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tO5sxLapAts">South Park episode</a> in 1998, fifteen years ago!! It is hilariously ridiculous and unfortunately the strategy many startups operate under today. Let me explain.</p>

<p>You&#8217;re a first time entreprenuer on Step 1. Your company is in the early stages, readying for a product launch, working with initial customers, making moves. In fact, it&#8217;s been that way for a while. You&#8217;ve had some small wins, and some setbacks, but you persist; you continue to steal underpants, for success is just around the corner, right?</p>

<p>Now take a moment to think about your goals. Where do you want your company to end up? I&#8217;m sure you could paint me a vivid picture of your Google-acquired startup, and your traveling lifestyle, filled with fame and fortune. Your Step 3 is as clear as day.</p>

<p>But what is your plan for Step 2? For this we need to take a closer look at the entrepreneurial landscape and the limited paths to success. Then we can better understand the game we&#8217;re playing and the strategies needed to succeed.</p>

<h3>Success is rare</h3>

<p>At any given point there are an infinite number of tasks your company can be working on: promoting, building, hiring, networking, etc. Lets assume that every set of decisions represents a path to either success or failure. Unfortunately, most of these paths lead to failure (see the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_law">power law</a>). The CS degree that I&#8217;m still paying for says I should visualize this as a search tree.</p>

<p><img src="http://nathanspeller.com/images/blog/paths-to-success-graph.png" /></p>

<p>If the problem is presented this way, there are a few conclusions we can make. First, succeeding on intuition alone is nearly impossible. You are inexperienced and there are just too many paths to consider. (In fact, this model doesn&#8217;t even take into account that luck is a very real factor and most of the paths are unknown i.e. you can&#8217;t see the paths you don&#8217;t think of).</p>

<p>Second, before you succeed you must fail many times. Learning what doesn&#8217;t work and backtracking is a necessary step. In fact, it&#8217;s the <strong>most common event you&#8217;ll face</strong>. Yet most founders will avoid it like the plague. They keep doing what they&#8217;re doing, hoping for change (instead of measuring it), and rationalizing their decisions along the way.</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll be successful as soon as we launch.&#8221;<br>&#8220;Our sales will blow up after we finish that feature.&#8221;<br>&#8220;If we get just a little more funding, it&#8217;ll work.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>We lose sight of our progress, or lack thereof, and get stuck in the proverbial weeds. The reality is that most startups rarely question the path they&#8217;re on. They will&#8230;</p>

<ul>
<li> build for years without ever speaking to potential customers</li>
<li> spend months making an unwanted product scalable</li>
<li> hold off product launches (read potential failure) until they&#8217;re <em>really</em> ready</li>
<li> plan inventory management systems for a product nobody wants</li>
<li> spam the internet with their new service and wonder why no one will buy it</li>
<li> blindly, prematurely push sales because the investors expect growth</li>
<li> waste time coming up with solutions to questions no one has asked</li>
</ul>


<p>This happens because we&#8217;re not using a systematic approach to solving our entrepreneurial problems. We let our intuition (read irrational emotions) guide our choices and rarely take the time to evaluate our decisions.</p>

<p>We need a strategy.</p>

<p>There is the Lean Startup method, customer-driven development, the scientific method and many more. We&#8217;ve heard their principles, although we don&#8217;t really follow them. For most of us they&#8217;ve been reduced to networking buzz words.</p>

<p>Although you may not use any of these methods, you must have some sort of method. The particular steps are not what&#8217;s important here. What&#8217;s important is the common thread these methods share: systematic feedback and reevaluation. That is, regularly stepping back and reevaluating your progress, hypotheses, and decisions (your path) based on new information you&#8217;ve learned.</p>

<p>Always be able to answer the following:</p>

<ul>
<li> What questions are you trying to answer?</li>
<li> When will you get that answer?</li>
<li> What metrics do you use to measure progress?</li>
<li> How often do you reevaluate?</li>
<li> What have you learned from past failures?</li>
<li> Why are you doing what you&#8217;re doing?</li>
<li> What are you trying to learn?</li>
<li> Is there a faster cheaper way to get the information you need?</li>
</ul>


<p>This is the only way to systematically remove &#8220;failure paths&#8221; without wasting valuable time and energy.</p>

<p>Startups deal with so much uncertainty that you can&#8217;t just work harder or longer hours. It doesn&#8217;t matter if you launch your product in six weeks instead of seven. Because without a method, six weeks can quickly become six months in the wrong direction.</p>

<p>Instead, you must work smarter. You must run your company like a laboratory. Ask the right questions. Create hypotheses. Create experiments to test your assumptions. Measure, measure, measure. Accept that most of your experiments will fail. Keep track of everything you learn. And repeat.</p>

<p>Success awaits at the top of a mountain built of failures and lessons learned.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>More often than not, bad stuff happens in the startup world. Customers complain, deals fall through, cofounders leave. When things get tough it&#8217;s easy to blame the external circumstances. &#8220;That investor screwed us over!&#8221; &#8220;That cofounder left us with nothing!&#8221;</p>

<p>Then I watch a superhero movie. You watch these guys (Batman, Spiderman, Ryan Gosling), who feel it is their duty to save the world. At any point they can give up and say &#8220;not my responsibility&#8221; but they persist.</p>

<p>They make my problems look so small. They make my problems look like… opportunities.</p>

<p>And I realize, I just need to take responsibility. Responsibility for my actions, for my team, and for my results. When I do, there&#8217;s no one to blame.</p>

    <link href="http://nathanspeller.com/phrasing/"/>
    <updated>2012-10-27T12:44:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://nathanspeller.com/phrasing</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There are a ton of books written on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/How-Talk-Kids-Will-Listen/dp/1451663889/">how to talk to children</a>. One topic I see frequently is how to properly phrase criticism. The idea is that when a child misbehaves, it&#8217;s said that you should denounce the action, yet praise the child. i.e. &#8220;she is a good kid who has done something wrong&#8221; - rather than &#8220;she is a terrible kid.&#8221;</p>

<p>Interestingly, anyone can apply this advice to their internal dialogue to learn what they think of themselves. For example, many people will say to themselves, &#8220;I&#8217;ve always been a lazy guy, but today I got a lot of work done - I did good today.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sounds okay, but this person actually defines himself as an unmotivated person who has happened to do something good. Alternatively, you might say &#8220;I accomplished a lot today because I&#8217;m disciplined and dedicated to achieving my goal. I may have had some setbacks but not today.&#8221; Similar, but very different.</p>

<p>Now lets look at some advice you&#8217;ve surely heard before:</p>

<blockquote>&#8220;There are those who think they will succeed and those who think they will fail. In the end, both are right.&#8221;</blockquote>


<p>This seems obvious, but it&#8217;s surprisingly easy to mess this up. The subtlety to this advice is in the phrasing. &#8220;You are a disciplined person who goes to the gym&#8221; is a very different thought than &#8220;you will go to the gym you lazy bum.&#8221; Both seem like motivation, but one isn&#8217;t motivation at all.</p>

<p>Start listening to your internal dialogue. To the tone, the mood, and the phrasing. Separate yourself from your inner voice and you&#8217;ll learn a lot about what you think of yourself.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Here&#8217;s a self-awareness tip.</p>

<p>While thinking through your problems, your mood can easily cloud your judgement. However, sometimes you&#8217;ll get so lost in your internal dialogue that you won&#8217;t realize the additional stress you&#8217;re causing yourself.</p>

<blockquote>&#8220;Ugh, I&#8217;m so lazy. I gotta start exercising. Where did these rolls come from?? I can&#8217;t go out with a gut like this. Oh they&#8217;re looking at me now.&#8221;</blockquote>


<p>In these cases, the actual words of your internal dialogue don&#8217;t matter. What matters is the tone. Stop and take out the words, using only &#8220;mmm&#8221; sounds and you&#8217;ll quickly discover the mood you&#8217;re in. Sounding whiny? Kill that internal dialogue on spot, make a decision, and stop worrying.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In a given day, who do you talk to most? A co-worker? Best friend? A significant other?</p>

<p>I&#8217;m willing to bet that there&#8217;s another person you speak to more. One that never stops talking to you, and never waits for your response. One that criticizes all your actions, second-guesses all your decisions, and nags you endlessly about how little you&#8217;ve accomplished. No, it&#8217;s not your mother and it&#8217;s not your ex.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s you.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s that voice in your head that never seems to quit:</p>

<blockquote>&#8220;I&#8217;ll start that personal project tomorrow.&#8221;<br>
&#8220;Geez, everyone else is so much more successful.&#8221;</blockquote>


<blockquote>&#8220;Just one more article and then I&#8217;ll start my work.&#8221;<br>
&#8220;Ugh, I&#8217;m so lazy.&#8221;</blockquote>


<blockquote>&#8220;Just one more slice of pie.&#8221;<br>
  &#8220;OMG I&#8217;m so fat.&#8221;</blockquote>


<p>You&#8217;ve tried to fix the situation with <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btPJPFnesV4">motivational</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsSC2vx7zFQ">youtube</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSM1mvMypWU">videos</a>, new workout tapes, the latest to-do lists (and to-do lists for your to-do lists). You get excited about your new found motivation. &#8220;I got this!!! There&#8217;s no way I can fail this time!!&#8221;</p>

<p>And yet, two weeks later you&#8217;re on the couch watching New Girl with your best friends Ben and Jerry.</p>

<p>Ironically, the problem is not your inability to stay &#8220;motivated.&#8221; Anyone can get excited about their goals for a short period of time (it&#8217;s called New Years). However, sustaining this amount of motivation is not only impractical but almost impossible. In order to really make progress you have to keep trucking when the motivation is gone.</p>

<p>But what&#8217;s left when the motivation is gone? Just that voice in your head; the internal dialogue that persuades you with &#8220;I&#8217;ll get started&#8230;tomorrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>Silence this voice and you&#8217;ll make real progress.</p>
