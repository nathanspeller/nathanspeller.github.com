In a given day, who do you talk to most? A co-worker? Best friend? A significant other?

I'm willing to bet that there's another person you speak to more. One that never stops talking to you, and never waits for your response. One that criticizes all your actions, second-guesses all your decisions, and nags you endlessly about how little you've accomplished. No, it's not your mother and it's not your ex. 

It's you. 

It's that voice in your head that never seems to quit: 
- "I'll start that personal project tomorrow"
"ugh, everyone else is so much more successful"
- "just one more article and then I'll start my work"
"ugh, I'm so lazy"
- "just one more donut" 
  "ugh, OMG I'm so fat"

You've tried to fix the situation with motivational youtube videos, new workout buddies, the latest to-do lists (to-do lists for your to-do lists), etc. You get excited about your new found motivation. You get pumped: "I got this!!! There's no way I can fail this time!!"

Yet the internal dialogue brings you down eventually.

Now don't blame the to-do list for your failure. The problem is not about staying in your heightened state of motivation. It's about perservering when all you want to do is flop on the couch with a sheet cake and watch New Girl. But how? The first step to overcoming this is separating yourself from your internal dialogue. 

<h2>Listen to your tone</h2>
Often you'll get so lost in your internal dialogue that you won't realize the stress you're causing yourself.

<blockquote>"Ugh, I'm so lazy. I gotta start exercising. Where did these rolls come from?? I can't go out with a gut like this. Oh they're looking at me now. They're probably thinking 'Wow, look at that guy, I can't believe he's drinking during his third trimester'"</blockquote>

In these cases, the actual words of your internal dialogue don't matter. What matters is the tone. Stop and take out the words, using only "mmm" sounds and you'll quickly discover the mood you're in. Sounding whiny? Kill that internal dialogue on spot, make a decision, and stop worrying. 

<h2>Listen to your phrasing</h2>
Now lets put the words back in and take a look at your phrasing. This is an often talked about topic for new parents. When a child misbehaves, it's said that you should denounce the action, yet praise the child. i.e. "she is a good kid who has done something wrong" - rather than "she is a terrible kid".

Now how does this relate to internal dialogue? Many people will do the opposite in their internal dialogue: "Im a lazy, unmotivated person. But today I went to the gym - I did good today". Here, this person defines himself by the negative attributes and unintentionally creates a tremendous mental hurdle. Rather one should think "I went to the gym today because I'm disciplined and dedicated to achieving my goal."

You hear this kind of advice from others all the time: 

<blockquote>"There are those who think they will succeed and those who think they will fail. In the end, both are right."</blockquote>
<blockquote>"Believe in yourself."</blockquote> 

The subtlety to this advice is in the phrasing. "I am a disciplined person who goes to the gym" is a very different thought than "you will go to the gym you lazy sack of shit". Both seem like motivation, but only one works.

Start listening to yourself. To the tone, the mood, and the phrasing. Separate yourself from your internal dialogue.

Only then can you start sticking to your goals.
