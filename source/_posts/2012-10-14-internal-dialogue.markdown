In a given day, who do you talk to most? A co-worker? Best friend? A significant other?

I'm willing to bet that there's another person you speak to more. One that never stops talking to you, and never waits for your response. One that criticizes all your actions, second-guesses all your decisions, and nags you endlessly about how little you've accomplished. No, it's not your mother and it's not your ex. 

It's you. 

It's that voice in your head that never seems to quit: 
<blockquote>"I'll start that personal project tomorrow"<br>
"geez, everyone else is so much more successful"</blockquote>
<blockquote>"just one more article and then I'll start my work"<br>
"ugh, I'm so lazy"</blockquote>
<blockquote>"just one more slice of pie"<br>
  "OMG I'm so fat"</blockquote>

You've tried to fix the situation with motivational youtube videos, new workout tapes, the latest to-do lists (to-do lists for your to-do lists), etc. You get excited about your new found motivation. "I got this!!! There's no way I can fail this time!!"

Yet the internal dialogue brings you down eventually.

Now don't blame the to-do list for your failure. The problem is not about staying in your heightened state of motivation. It's about perservering when all you want to do is flop on the couch with a sheet cake and watch New Girl. But how? The first step to overcoming this is separating yourself from your internal dialogue.
