Now lets put the words back in and take a look at your phrasing. This is an often talked about topic for new parents. When a child misbehaves, it's said that you should denounce the action, yet praise the child. i.e. "she is a good kid who has done something wrong" - rather than "she is a terrible kid".

Now how does this relate to internal dialogue? Many people will do the opposite in their internal dialogue: "Im a lazy, unmotivated person. But today I went to the gym - I did good today". Here, this person defines himself by the negative attributes and unintentionally creates a tremendous mental hurdle. Rather one should think "I went to the gym today because I'm disciplined and dedicated to achieving my goal."

You hear this kind of advice from others all the time: 

<blockquote>"There are those who think they will succeed and those who think they will fail. In the end, both are right."</blockquote>
<blockquote>"Believe in yourself."</blockquote> 

The subtlety to this advice is in the phrasing. "I am a disciplined person who goes to the gym" is a very different thought than "you will go to the gym you lazy sack of shit". Both seem like motivation, but only one works.

Start listening to yourself. To the tone, the mood, and the phrasing. Separate yourself from your internal dialogue.

Only then can you start sticking to your goals.
