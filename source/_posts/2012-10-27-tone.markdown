Often you'll get so lost in your internal dialogue that you won't realize the stress you're causing yourself.

<blockquote>"Ugh, I'm so lazy. I gotta start exercising. Where did these rolls come from?? I can't go out with a gut like this. Oh they're looking at me now. They're probably thinking 'Wow, look at that guy, I can't believe he's drinking during his third trimester'"</blockquote>

In these cases, the actual words of your internal dialogue don't matter. What matters is the tone. Stop and take out the words, using only "mmm" sounds and you'll quickly discover the mood you're in. Sounding whiny? Kill that internal dialogue on spot, make a decision, and stop worrying.
